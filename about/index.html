        <p><i>Code, Design &amp; Coffee</i> is my website, blog and a place where I write about things that interest me. Mainly, programming, design, productivity and endurance training, but I write pretty much about anything that comes to my mind. Sometimes I find myself taking photos, playing guitar and tinkering with electronics and microcontrollers.</p>

        <p>Since 2008, I'm working for myself as a designer and iOS developer. From 2009 to 2014 I run web development agency back in my hometown in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tbilisi">Tbilisi</a>. After moving to Japan in 2014, I'm back to being one-man band iOS app shop.</p>

        <p>Today, I'm working with my clients on iOS apps and working on Forged---iOS fitness trainer. You can follow along and read [developer journal][fg]. I also do many other things you can read about on `/now` page which was inspired by [Derek Sivers][ds]. I update it at least once a month with things I'm focused on at the moment.</p>

        <p>In 2014, I got obsessed with endurance sports---running, cycling, triathlon and alike---while trying to get in shape after being overweight from very early childhood. There is a [training log][tl] page, which I update daily.</p>

        <p>I'm huge bogging and podcast fan. On this website, you can find [blogs I read][br] and podcast I listen to (coming soon).</p>

        <p>You can read about tech and geeky bits of this blog on [acknowledgments][ap] page.</p>

        <p>There are no comments on this website. In case you want to send feedback, I encourage you to write response blog post and send me a link to it via [Twitter](//twitter.com/totocaster) or [email](mailto:hello@codedesigncoffee.net).</p>

        <p>I also love coffee in case you didn't notice.</p>

        <p>As of late March 2017, I am in living Japan with my wife. While she is doing her Masters degree I'm focused on things below:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>iOS consulting work,</li>
          <li>Programming <em>The Foundry</em></li>
          <li>Running, cycling and swimming every day.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>I update this list time to time. It serves as a good reminder of what I should be focusing on. Not that I have problem focusing.</p>
