title: Hi!
---

I'm Toto, or Tornike Tvalavadze for forms, bills and passport.

<i>Code, Design &amp; Coffee</i> is my website, blog and a place where I write about things that interest me. Mainly, programming, design, productivity and endurance training, but I write pretty much about anything that comes to my mind. Sometimes I find myself taking photos, playing guitar and tinkering with electronics and microcontrollers.

Since 2008, I'm working for myself as a designer and iOS developer. From 2009 to 2014 I run web development agency back in my hometown in [Tbilisi][tbi]. After moving to Japan in 2014, I'm back to being one-man band iOS app shop.

Today, I'm working with my clients on iOS apps and working on Forged---iOS fitness trainer. You can follow along and read [developer journal][fg]. I also do [many other things](/now) you can read about on `/now` page which was inspired by [Derek Sivers][ds]. I update it at least once a month with things I'm focused on at the moment.

In 2014, I got obsessed with endurance sports---running, cycling, triathlon and alike---while trying to get in shape after being overweight from very early childhood. There is a [training log][tl] page, which I update daily.

I'm huge bogging and podcast fan. On this website, you can find [blogs I read][br] and podcast I listen to (coming soon).

You can read about tech and geeky bits of this blog on [acknowledgments][ap] page.

There are no comments on this website. In case you want to send feedback, I encourage you to write response blog post and send me a link to it via [Twitter](//twitter.com/totocaster) or [email](mailto:hello@codedesigncoffee.net).

I also love coffee in case you didn't notice.

Thanks for stopping by.
