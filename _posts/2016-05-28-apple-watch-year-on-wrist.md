I love wristwatches, [mechanical](https://www.omegawatches.com/watches/speedmaster/moonwatch/product/), [electronic](http://www.gshock.com/watches/Trending/DW5600SL-7), [field](http://www.hamiltonwatch.com/collection/khaki/field/titanium-auto/h70575733), [silly](http://mickeymousecollectibles.com/graphics/watch-classic.jpg), [grand-complications](http://www.patek.com/en/mens-watches/grand-complications), [tourbillons](http://www.cartier.com/collections/watches/mens-watches/rotonde-de-cartier/w1556242-rotonde-de-cartier-watch.html), [dress watches](http://www.patek.com/en/mens-watches/calatrava), [divers](http://www.rolex.com/watches/submariner/m116610ln-0001.html), all of them. They serve as jewelry, and most importantly for me—as an everyday utility tool — of which so many people no longer believe in.

“I have time on my phone” — they say. True, but try using buttons on your TV instead of remote for a week. That’s how it feels for watch-wearer without a time on a wrist.

I’ve been wearing Apple Watch every single day since it arrived on May 15, 2015. For some, it may look like I took off my mechanical watch and replaced it with, electronic, battery powered, “smartwatch”. For me, it felt like an upgrade — replacing previous with one which is a bit more useful.

So what is Apple Watch?

> It’s just a digital watch, reimagined for today’s world, …

Simple as that. In the age of ubiquitous connectivity, Bluetooth everything, internet of things, always-on fitness trackers, WiFi cameras and cars that can almost drive themselves, connected watch that can show you things other than time makes perfect sense.

I’ll skip few obvious and widely covered positives: build quality, bands, and customizability. All of those are on par if not better than any other watch you can get. Watch itself is build with astonishing precision and bands are just top notch. My favorite is Link Bracelet. It is stronger, lighter, thinner and way more comfortable than any traditional bracelet you are thinking about now. In short, Apple absolutely, positively nailed hardware and build quality.

With that out of the way, here are thing I believe Apple got right that was not so obvious at launch:

- Battery life is a non-issue at all if you charge it overnight, every night. Watch will last whole day no matter what I do, even with four-hour bike rides with optical heart rate monitor on. I can make a whole day with ~25% of battery by the end of the day. On days without workouts—40 to 60% is very realistic. In one year, I’ve never run out of battery or switched to power saving mode.
- Having Siri on the watch is surprisingly nice, I even disabled “Hey Siri” on my iPhone so it won’t get triggered when I say it to watch. Timers, quick unit conversions, reminders, all great on the wrist.
- Apple Pay is something I can’t comment because it’s not yet available in Japan, but everyone I know with Watch prefer Apple Pay on wrist to a phone.
- Phone calls from Watch (I can hear eyes rolling, but hear me out.) are very convenient, both FaceTime Audio and cellular. I avoid doing that in public places, it is awkward and there is high chance you won’t hear person on the other end. But, when home alone or in similiar situation, it’s unbelievably convenient to be hands and phone free while talking on the phone.
- Remote shutter for Camera app on the phone. Again, something I would never think of. Having the option to trigger camera from the watch (with clear and good live preview) is one of the nices features of Watch while traveling or just for taking group photos.
- App Notifications are usefull, but many, even slightly “dumber” watches today can do this. I don’t find anything remarkable in this.
- Having weather forecast on watch-face however, is something I would never think would be so important. I can’t imagine wearing watch that can not show weather from now on.
- It tells time. Well duh. But, by far not all watches (or smartphones) are great at it. Especially when it comes to multiple time zones, timers, location and timed reminders, countdown timers, calendar events and all of those things associated with time.

Having said that, not everything about Apple Watch is that great as you might already notice if you read tech press.

> “…it’s kind of slow.”

This is very true. There are parts of the Watch I wish never made to release. Those are most talked about things in the press and that does make an impression that the whole concept of having a modern watch is dumb.

You can “fix” slowness by simply using apps more frequently. A device is constrained by computing power rather than operating memory, thus, if you use apps frequently enough that they don’t terminate due to inactivity, watch feels quite snappy. In my tests, watch can hold around ten apps running in memory for hour or so (why not forever Apple?). Those in-memory apps start fast, but every cold start is painful and leads to “Ah, forget about it! I’ll do that on the phone!”.

This brings us to another issue—there aren’t many good apps. Most of them try to do same as their iPhone counterparts, which is not necessarily something convenient when done on the wrist. Apparently designing apps for Watch is hard.

By contrast, apps that are “made for wrist” are so much nicer than their’ phone counterparts. Weather and 1Password are great examples.

With that, here are few other not so good details and some sort of Wishlist for future Apple Watch versions:

- New watch faces and Complications. The current selection is quite small, I personally use only one—chronograph. I appreciate Apple’s attempt to represent time in different ways. Jellyfish, Solar, and timelapse watch faces are great examples of that, but when it comes to more traditional watch faces, things get a bit limited. Well, very limited. Having at least twice as many watch-faces to the current collection would be nice. Watch-face APIs for developers would be even nicer. (After looking at Android Wear 3rd party watch-face selection I sort of understand why Apple is not keen on doing that, but hey, there are painfully ugly apps on App Store as well.)
- Get rid of time should be only in top right corner paradigm on digital watch-faces. This is solely aesthetic and self-imposed constraint that limits many different and interesting ways of expressing time on a watch-face.
- Stronger Taptic Engine. Stainless Steel models have significantly weaker taps compared to Sport models, but even aluminum version could benefit from stronger taps. It’s worth mentioning that having Taptic Engine instead of vibration motor use in other watches does make huge difference, taps are inaudible.
- New case materials. Titanium, ceramic, bronze (have you seen new Tudor Black Bay Bronze? It’s gorgeous), higher grade stainless steel, etc.
- Apple Watch Sport to become just Apple Watch and pricier options to have names based on case material or collaboration. Something like: Apple Watch Stainless Steel, Apple Watch Hermès, Apple Watch Ceramic, etc. It’s hard to see Watch becoming popular when it’s marketed as a posh gadget. (This seems to become true very soon. I challenge you find a word about Edition on current Apple.com within few minutes.)
- Ideally, cheapest Apple Watch to be priced as iPod nano. (I know, highly unrealistic, but this is a Wishlist.)
- Built-in GPS, because current running watch market looks like smartphone market before iPhone. Secondly, every time Watch is asking iPhone some GPS data, that “Ah, forget about it! I’ll do it on the phone!” feeling creeps in.
- More health sensors. Something like blood sugar meter would be invaluable for many.
- Cellular data. Future with only iPad and a Watch is very tempting.
- Better Siri and voice recognition. That’s not a Watch issue per se, but that’s where I use Siri most.
- Unlike iPhones’ 3D Touch, Force Touch as implemented in watchOS 2 is a gimmick. Putting contextual menu under, so called, side button would be better, and arguably more discoverable.
- Speaking of side button — Digital Touch, oh boy. I was one of the biggest fan of silly jumbo Emoji and ability to send taps, heartbeat and sketches to friends, but that didn’t work out. Maybe it will make sense if Apple Watch gets as popular as iPhone, but today, it’s just not something useful at all. This makes side button, probably second most unused button in industry. (First can be found on PC keyboards.)
- Always on screen is something I don’t care too much because activate on wrist raise works unbelievably well for me, but having a watch that is not black glass screen almost all the time would be nicer.
- Better/faster developer tools. At the moment, I find working on Apple Watch apps, unlike iPhone apps, quite a hustle. Debugging apps is unstable, testing live sensor data is a pain, everything happens way too slowly.

I can go on with this list forever. And this is a paradox of Apple Watch. Reading all above, one could be amazed why I still wear it and suffer through all of those issues. Thing is, I love using Apple Watch, I find huge utility in wearing it every day and none of the issues above – of which there are many – can overweight simple convince of having small bits of important information and interactions on the wrist.

I don’t know whether Apple Watch is the best smartwatch or not. Honestly, I don’t even care. What I know is that Apple Watch is best (read: most useful) wristwatch I have ever had and when Apple makes one without flaws above, it will be even better.
