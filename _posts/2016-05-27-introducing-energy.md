Few days ago I published an app which I use internally for quite a while. _Energy_ is a manual calorie counter which helped me lose quite a few kilograms and then maintain my current weight for several years.

I made simple [product page](http://codedesigncoffee.net/energy) for it which this post links to. Energy served me very well for few years now, I'd be happy if many find it useful too.
