Yamazaki is best known Japanese whisky worldwide, and for the good reason. It's perfect Scotch-style whisky one can drink. Unlike its Scotish no age statement siblings, Yamazaki NAS contains liquids aging from 8 to 20 years. It is bottled at 43% ABV so I don't feel bad adding big ice sphere in summer. Only drawback this drink can have is that it's _too well balanced_ and is tad boring after couple of bottles. For such occasions there always Yamazaki 12 YO and 18 YO.
